Data Types

This file demonstrates the core concepts of JavaScript Data Types and Object Manipulation through a simple web-based implementation. It serves as a practical guide for understanding how variables are declared and how data structures can be dynamically updated in real-time.

Key Technical Concepts
Variable Declarations: Shows the use of var and let for storing numbers and strings, including valid naming conventions like _a.

Primitive Data Types: Explores the use of typeof to identify and log different types such as number and string to the console.

Object Literals: Demonstrates how to define structured data using key-value pairs.

Object Mutation: Illustrates the dynamic nature of JavaScript objects by adding new properties (e.g., salary) and updating existing values after the object has been initialized.

DOM Integration: Includes a basic HTML structure (datatypes.html) that serves as the host environment for the script execution.

Code Execution Flow
Initialization: Variables and objects are defined in the global scope.

Type Checking: The console outputs the data types to verify correct assignment.

Dynamic Update: The script adds a salary property to the o object and subsequently modifies it to show how data evolves during execution.
